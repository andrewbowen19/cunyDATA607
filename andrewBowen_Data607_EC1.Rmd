# Extra Credit #1

```{r}
library('dplyr')

```

I found [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data) containing daily climate measurements in Delhi, India from 1st January 2013 to 24th April 2017.
```{r}
# Reading in from GitHub
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/cunyDATA607/main/data/DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv"

df <- read.csv(data_url, header=TRUE)

head(df, 10)
```

First, we'll need to cast the `date` column to a date type.
```{r}
df$date <- as.Date(df$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
head(df, 10)
```
Let's calculate the 6-day rolling average of each measurement first
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  mutate(meantemp_6day = cumsum(meantemp))

head(df)
```
